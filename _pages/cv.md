# Research & Project Experiences

+ Apr 2022 - Sept 2022: **OpenBackdoor: An open-source toolkit for textual backdoor attack and defense**
  * Directed by Associate [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), THUNLP.

  * Summarize three practical scenarios of attack methods based on their accessibility and goals.
  * Conclude novel metrics for three evaluation dimensions and recommend scenario-specified evaluation methodologies.
  * Develop an open-source toolkit [OpenBackdoor](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenBackdoor) and conduct extensive benchmark experiments.
  * Propose **CUBE**, a simple yet strong baseline method targeting purifying poisoned datasets.
  * Second author. Paper submitted to NeurIPS 2022 D&B.
+ Jul 2023 - Now: Research and development based on semantic understanding with Chinese characteristics
  + Language: Python
  + From: MIGU
  + Responsibilities: Core Member
  + Solution: Using CPM-C as the base model, we extensively collect data including the MFAs’speeches, etc., and carry out post-training, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF three-stage training.
